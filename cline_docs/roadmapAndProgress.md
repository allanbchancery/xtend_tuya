# Roadmap and Progress

## Project Goals

### Primary Goal: Fix Login Authentication Issue
- [ ] Identify root cause of login failures
- [ ] Analyze authentication flow in config_flow.py
- [ ] Examine Tuya API integration components
- [ ] Test authentication with different credential types
- [ ] Implement fix for login issues
- [ ] Validate fix with test credentials

### Secondary Goals: Code Analysis and Documentation
- [x] Clone repository and set up project structure
- [x] Create documentation framework
- [ ] Document authentication flow
- [ ] Identify potential security issues
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Repository cloned successfully to ~/Downloads/xtend_tuya
- [x] Initial project structure analysis completed
- [x] Documentation framework created (cline_docs/)
- [x] README.md analysis completed
- [x] config_flow.py examination completed
- [x] const.py constants analysis completed
- [x] Tuya sharing manager analysis completed
- [x] Tuya IoT manager analysis completed
- [x] OpenAPI wrapper analysis completed
- [x] Main initialization file analysis completed
- [x] Multi-manager coordination analysis completed
- [x] Authentication flow documentation completed
- [x] Root cause analysis completed
- [x] Potential fixes identified and documented

## Current Focus
**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The OpenAPI authentication in `tuya_iot/init.py` requires ALL 4 validation steps to succeed, but this is overly strict and causes unnecessary failures. The most immediate fix needed is to simplify the validation logic.

## Next Immediate Action
Implement Fix 3 (Improved OpenAPI Authentication) from loginIssueAnalysis.md as it addresses the most common cause of login failures.
